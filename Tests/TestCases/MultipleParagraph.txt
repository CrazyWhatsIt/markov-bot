Rounding to nearest is the standard form of rounding used in financial and statistical operations. It conforms to IEEE Standard 754, section 4. When used in multiple rounding operations, it reduces the rounding error that is caused by consistently rounding midpoint values in a single direction. In some cases, this rounding error can be significant.
The following example illustrates the bias that can result from consistently rounding midpoint values in a single direction. The example computes the true mean of an array of Decimal values, and then computes the mean when the values in the array are rounded by using the two conventions. In this example, the true mean and the mean that results when rounding to nearest are the same. However, the mean that results when rounding away from zero differs by .05 (or by 3.6%) from the true mean.
